        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a licensed psychologist with over 
            [X] years of experience in helping individuals
             navigate life's challenges and discover paths 
             to emotional well-being. My approach 
             integrates evidence-based practices with
              a deep understanding of each personâ€™s
               unique journey. Whether it's managing 
               stress, overcoming anxiety, or building 
               healthier relationships,
               I provide a safe and supportive space 
               for growth and healing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in cognitive-behavioral 
                therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and 
                trauma-informed care, working closely 
                with adults, adolescents, and families.
                My goal is to empower individuals to
                thrive, offering compassionate guidance
                and personalized strategies for mental 
                and emotional health.
